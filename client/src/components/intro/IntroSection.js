            Welcome to Dream Capture! 
I have always loved crafting and creating, and it has always been a dream of mine to be able to create beautiful pieces and share my creations with the world. Dream Capture is my vessel to do so! I take inspiration from things around me, online – Pinterest especially! I try to create things I would love to see and own myself, and of course I love getting requests as well. 
So please feel free to take a look around. Share with your friends and family if you like or place an order for something special! If you are looking for something and don’t see it here – please feel free to pop me a mail and let’s chat about how to capture your custom design and make that dream a reality.
